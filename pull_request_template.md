# Strategy Onboarding

## TODO List

Onboarding tasks:

- [✅] Task 1: Implement `fibonacci_term()` in `fibonacci.py`
  - All tests in `test_fibonacci.py` should pass, run `pytest` command to check
- [✅] Task 2: Implement `find_min_index()` and `reverse_str_arr()`
  - Write tests that cover the logic that you wrote in `test_array.py`
- [✅] Task 3: Process and visualize sample data in `matplot.py`
  - Read data in CSV using `pandas` or `csv`, handle the missing values, plot using `matplotlib`
  - Include a screenshot of your graph in the PR


Some extra items:

- [✅] Completed [strategy welcome survey](https://forms.gle/xnYBumyAn2mA2Ao68)
