# Task 3 - Strategy team onboarding call

The onboarding call is for the strategy leads to get to know you (and vice versa). We'll introduce you to the team and what we're currently working on. We'll also talk about your skills/previous experience(s) and try to assign you work that fits your interests and commitment. We won't be asking any technical questions.

## Step 1

Make sure you've completed task 2 and have created a pull request on GitHub

## Step 2

Send a (private) Slack message to 1 of the strategy leads requesting an interview/call. Also send a link to your pull request so we can make sure you've done task 2

## Step 3

Do the interview! Once you're done, move onto task 4
