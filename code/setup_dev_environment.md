# Setup dev environment

The software/tools listed below is not inclusive of all the software/tools that you may use - this is only a list of common software/tools that you may or encounter while you're on the team. The projects/work that you're involved in may involve other software/tools that are not listed below.

Setting up your dev environment will not get you set up in the sense that you can start coding. Different projects may involve different setup procedures and it is best for you to contact the "owner" of the project to set up your environment (for that specific project).

Please download the software/tools associated with your operating system.
