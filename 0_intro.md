# Intro

Welcome to strategy onboarding! This repo is designed to help get you onboarded to the strategy subteam. These onboarding docs are meant to be self-contained and self-paced (although we recommend that you finish ASAP so you can start working on our tasks). You only need to reach out to us (the strategy leads) when you're done working through these onboarding docs.

Our subteam primarily focuses on 3 things: Automating decision-making calculations, monitoring the solar car's status, and developing software/tools for other subteams. Unlike other subteams, our tasks are often done individually (as we have multiple projects going on at once). As a result, you will have a lot of ownership of your work.

This term (Winter 2024), we are focusing on completing [Victini](https://github.com/uw-midsun/victini-core), a real-time communication service that allows the solar car to send data to our server(s) for data processing.

Beginners can expect to be given tasks such as data validation (QA) and research. Experienced devs can work on "nice-to-have's" tickets. These are tickets that aren't "mission critical" but will significantly impact our software processes. Examples include reducing 3rd-party API usage by implementing async API calls, or using NED10 datasets to improve elevation data accuracy (to ~10 meters). Core services/infrastructure tasks are mostly reserved for pre-existing members due to the huge learning curve needed to understand our code/systems. Lastly, as we are on a tight deadline (competition is within 6 months), we aren't able to provide as much guidance as we would like, so we don't recommend beginners attempting "nice-to-have's" tickets. Suggested experience/prerequisites are listed below:

| Beginners | Experienced (In addition to "beginners") |
| --------- | :--------------------------------------: |
| Git       |                  Docker                  |
| Python    |             API Development              |
|           |              SQL/Databases               |
|           |           NumPy, Pandas, etc.            |
