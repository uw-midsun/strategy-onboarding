# strategy-onboarding

Hey, welcome to strategy onboarding :) We're experimenting with a new onboarding setup, and always welcoming feedback.

This onboarding is simply a checklist of things you have to do to get up to speed and start working on some cool stuff with the team. We have 4 tasks you need to do to join the team: some administrative work, a couple coding exercises, an onboarding call with the team, and a guide to help you set up your dev environment

Feel free to message Prabhav Khera, Rodrigo Tiscareno, Ryan Lam, or Kenneth Ruan on Slack with any questions.
