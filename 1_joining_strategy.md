# Joining Strategy

## Project Management

Make sure that you've signed up for the team and have access to our tools (Confluence, Slack, etc.)

- Slack
- Confluence and Jira

## Communications

Join the `#general` channel in Slack and fill out the "Midnight Sun Census" Google form. There is 1 form per term so make sure you fill it out for the correct term. Afterwards, join the `#gen-strategy` channel in Slack and fill out the "Strategy Team Sign Up" form. The form is bookmarked in the channel.

There is also a doc named "Midnight Sun Member Handbook" bookmarked in the channel. Go take a look and check out how the team works.
